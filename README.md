# Module 2 Challenge - Personal Portfolio

## Description
This project is a personal portfolio; an essential tool of any developer who would like to showcase their work, explain what they do and the benefits of utilizing their services. The page has working links which bring the user to the section with the same headline.

The purpose of this project was to practice what has been learned in the bootcamp so far in a practical way.
